## ðŸ§® How Price Differential (Basis) is Calculated in Commodity Forwards

In natural gas and other physical commodity trades, the **price differential** (also called **basis**) reflects the cost difference between the **index hub price** (like NYMEX Henry Hub) and the **actual delivery location**.

---

### ðŸ“Œ What is a Basis?

A **basis** is the adjustment added to (or subtracted from) an index price to reflect:

- **Transportation cost**
- **Local supply/demand imbalance**
- **Storage availability**
- **Market liquidity or congestion**
- **Weather-driven spikes**

---

### ðŸ”¢ Basis Pricing Formula

Final Price = Index Price + Basis Differential
- If the delivery point is *more expensive* than the hub â†’ **positive basis**
- If the delivery point is *cheaper* than the hub â†’ **negative basis**

---

### ðŸ”„ Example Calculation

Letâ€™s say:

- **Index Hub**: NYMEX Henry Hub
- **Delivery Location**: Transco Zone 6 NY
- **Index Price** (on July 10): `$2.75/MMBtu`
- **Agreed Basis**: `+$0.85/MMBtu`

Then:
Effective Trade Price = 2.75 + 0.85 = $3.60/MMBtu


---

### ðŸ’¡ How is the Basis Agreed?

- Negotiated between **marketer and customer**
- Reflects **market fundamentals** and **pipeline tariffs**
- Traders often refer to **historical spreads** and **basis curve forwards**

---

### ðŸ“Š In Endur

In **Endur**, the basis can be:

- A **static dollar value** (e.g., `+0.85`)
- A **basis curve** (dynamic, varies by day/month)
- Entered in the **Pricing Tab** during deal capture
- Applied to each day during pricing and valuation

### ðŸ§  Tip from Traders

> "The basis tells you what the local market is doing. You can be long Henry Hub but short Chicago just by changing basis."
