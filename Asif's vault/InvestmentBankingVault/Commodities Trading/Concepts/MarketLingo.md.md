### ‚úÖ Explanation: Lingo in the Financial Markets

#### Why Does Lingo Matter?

Financial markets operate fast. Traders and brokers must communicate **quickly and precisely**. Over time, a specialized ‚Äútrading lingo‚Äù evolved to:

- Save time
    
- Reduce ambiguity
    
- Enable seamless communication under pressure
    

This lingo includes terms like:

- **Bid / Offer**
    
- **Market**
    
- **Hit the bid / Lift the offer**
    
- **Handles and shorthand**
    
- And specific formats for placing orders

### üîπ Key Terms and Concepts

#### üìå Bid / Offer (a.k.a. Ask)

- **Bid**: The highest price a buyer is willing to pay.
    
- **Offer** (or Ask): The lowest price a seller is willing to accept.
    
- Example: If a trader says "two bid at three," it might mean:
    
    - $2.02 is the **bid**
        
    - $2.03 is the **offer**
        

This creates a **Bid/Offer Spread**: the difference between bid and offer. It‚Äôs also just called ‚Äúthe market.‚Äù

#### üìå Making a Market vs. Requesting a Market

- **Making a market**: Quoting both bid and offer prices.
    
- **Requesting a market**: Asking someone else (like a broker) for the current bid/offer.
    

Even when quote screens exist, traders often **ask for the market** for 4 reasons:

1. **Quote screens may lag** real-time prices.
    
2. Screens usually don‚Äôt show the bid/offer spread.
    
3. OTC products (like swaps) have no quote screens‚Äîonly brokers know.
    
4. Asking gives more info: volume at bid vs. offer, market sentiment, etc.

#### üìå Handle and Shorthand Quoting

- **Handle**: The whole dollar part of a price (e.g., the ‚Äú2‚Äù in $2.03).
    
- Traders often **omit the handle** in fast speech.
    
    - ‚ÄúTwo bid at three‚Äù might be:
        
        - $2.02/$2.03
            
        - $2.32/$2.33
            
        - Traders infer the handle based on market context.
            

> If you‚Äôre unsure, ask the broker for the ‚Äúfull handle.‚Äù

---

#### üìå Order Format

When placing trades:

- **Buy**: ‚ÄúPay (price) for (volume)‚Äù
    
- **Sell**: ‚ÄúSell (volume) at (price)‚Äù
    

**Example Conversation:**

> You: ‚ÄúHi. My account number is 1234. How is Feb. natgas?‚Äù  
> Broker: ‚ÄúFeb natgas is two bid at three‚Äî100 by 50.‚Äù  
> You: ‚ÄúPlease pay three for 25.‚Äù  
> Broker: ‚ÄúOkay. Paying $2.03 for 25 Feb. natgas?‚Äù  
> You: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
> Broker: ‚ÄúOrder filled.‚Äù ‚úÖ

#### üìå Hit the Bid / Lift the Offer

- **Lift the offer**: Buy at the ask/offer price
    
- **Hit the bid**: Sell at the bid price
    

If a trader wants to act quickly:

- To **buy immediately**, they must "lift the offer"
    
- To **sell immediately**, they must "hit the bid"
    

If they‚Äôre patient, they might place a bid/offer and **wait** for the market to meet them.

#### üß† Final Notes

- Market lingo evolves. What was used 10 years ago may not be in use today.
    
- Always **clarify if uncertain**, especially in volatile or unfamiliar markets.
