## ðŸ“ˆ Forward Curves and Settlement Prices in Natural Gas Markets

In natural gas trading, **forward curves** and **settlement prices** are foundational concepts that help market participants understand price expectations and finalize trades. These two are closely connected but serve distinct purposes.

### What is a Forward Curve?

The **forward curve** is a graphical representation of the marketâ€™s expectation of natural gas prices at future points in time. It shows the prices at which natural gas contracts for delivery in various future months or periods are currently trading.

- **Shape and Interpretation:**
    
    - The curve can be **upward sloping (contango)** if future prices are higher than current prices, often reflecting carrying costs like storage or expectations of rising demand.
        
    - It can be **downward sloping (backwardation)** if future prices are lower than current prices, which may indicate anticipated supply gluts or near-term demand spikes.
        
- **How Itâ€™s Formed:**
    
    - Derived from the prices of futures contracts trading on exchanges like NYMEX.
        
    - Reflects aggregated market sentiment, supply/demand forecasts, geopolitical events, weather forecasts, storage levels, and more.
        
- **Uses of the Forward Curve:**
    
    - **Price Discovery:** Helps market participants see what prices the market expects in coming months.
        
    - **Risk Management:** Used by producers and consumers to plan hedging strategies.
        
    - **Valuation:** Basis for valuing physical gas contracts and derivatives.
        
    - **Trading Strategy:** Traders exploit shape changes or divergences in the curve.

### What is a Settlement Price?

A **settlement price** is the official price published at the close of trading for a futures contract or index. It serves as the reference price for marking to market and settling financial obligations.

- **Role and Importance:**
    
    - Determines daily **mark-to-market (MTM)** gains and losses for futures positions.
        
    - Used to calculate margins required by clearinghouses.
        
    - Sets the final value for expiring futures contracts.
        
    - Often used as a **reference price for physical contracts** settled against indexes.
        
- **How Settlement Prices are Determined:**
    
    - Derived from the **last trades or the volume-weighted average price** over a defined closing period.
        
    - For indexes, often based on an average of physical trades reported during a **bid week** or a specific observation window.
        
    - Exchanges have strict methodologies to ensure prices represent fair market value, avoiding manipulation.

### Relationship Between Forward Curves and Settlement Prices

- The **forward curve is dynamic** and changes throughout the trading day as market participants buy and sell contracts.
    
- At the end of the trading day, the **settlement price** for each contract month is established, which then anchors that point on the forward curve for the next day.
    
- Settlement prices **represent a snapshot of market consensus** at a precise time and provide a standard for all market participants to reference.

### How Forward Prices Fluctuate During the Day

- Throughout a trading day, forward prices can move due to new informationâ€”weather forecasts, supply disruptions, geopolitical news, or inventory reports.
    
- This causes the **forward curve to fluctuate continuously**, reflecting changing market sentiment.
    
- Once the **settlement price is published at market close**, that price becomes the official market reference.
    
- The next trading dayâ€™s forward curve starts from these settlement prices, updated with new market data.

### Why Forward Curve and Settlement Prices Are Usually Close

- Since the forward curve is based on actively traded futures contracts, and settlement prices are derived from those same contractsâ€™ closing trades, the two generally remain close.
    
- Small differences can arise due to:
    
    - Intraday price volatility.
        
    - Bid-ask spreads.
        
    - Closing auction dynamics.

### Example: Forward Curve and Settlement Price for May Natural Gas Contract

- On April 10th, the May futures contract might trade at $2.50/MMBtu in the morning, reflecting expected price for delivery in May.
    
- As the day progresses, new info pushes the price to $2.55/MMBtu.
    
- At market close, the settlement price is officially published at $2.54/MMBtu.
    
- This $2.54 becomes the fixed reference price used for MTM calculations and forms the May point on the forward curve for the next day.
    
- If on April 11th, the market is bullish, the May futures contract may open at $2.60/MMBtu, updating the forward curve accordingly.

### Practical Implications for Market Participants

- **Traders:** Use the forward curve and settlement prices to manage risk and spot trading opportunities.
    
- **Hedgers:** Lock in prices based on settlement prices to stabilize cash flows.
    
- **Risk Managers:** Monitor daily settlement prices for exposure valuation and margining.
    
- **Physical Market Players:** Compare forward prices against physical spot prices to decide on buying, selling, or storing gas.

### Summary

- The **forward curve** is the marketâ€™s evolving view of future prices, continuously updated by trading activity.
    
- The **settlement price** is the official, end-of-day price fixing point used for clearing, margining, and reference.
    
- Settlement prices anchor the forward curve daily, creating a feedback loop that guides trading and risk management decisions.
    
- Understanding both is vital to navigate natural gas markets effectively.
