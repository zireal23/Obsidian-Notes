## üìö Commodities + Endur Structured Learning Plan

---

## **Tags**: `#learning-plan` `#commodities` `#endur`  
**Created**: {{date}}

### üéØ Goal

To develop a **deep, structured understanding** of commodities trading (physical & financial) and how it is represented, simulated, and processed inside **Openlink Endur**, by layering conceptual knowledge with technical mapping.

## üß± Layered Learning Framework

> Use this structure to link every concept across **three levels** for maximum retention.

| Layer       | Focus                                    | Example                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Level 1** | Core Commodities Concepts                | e.g., Forward contracts, swaps, VaR                          |
| **Level 2** | Endur Representation (ETRM layer)        | Deal types, simulations, reporting, tables                   |
| **Level 3** | Real-World Use Case / Trade Flow Mapping | How a gas forward is priced, simulated, and settled in Endur |
