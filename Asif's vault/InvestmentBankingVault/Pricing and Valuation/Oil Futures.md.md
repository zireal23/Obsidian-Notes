## 🛢️ Oil Futures — Term Structure Features Explained

### 📈 What Is the Term Structure of Oil Futures?

- It refers to the **curve formed by plotting oil futures prices** across different delivery dates (e.g., 1 month, 6 months, 1 year out).
    
- This curve provides insights into **market expectations**, **cost of carry**, and **supply-demand imbalances**.
    
- The **shape** of the curve — its **slope and steepness** — reveals a lot about market dynamics and trader sentiment.

## 🔁 Normal vs Inverted Market

### 🟩 Normal Market (Contango)

- The curve **slopes upward**:  
    `Futures Price (Long-term) > Futures Price (Short-term)`
    
- This reflects:
    
    - **Higher costs of storing oil** over time.
        
    - A relatively **well-supplied market** (low current demand, more certainty).
        
- Example: Crude oil in periods of high inventory → buyers are willing to pay more for future delivery because they avoid storage costs now.
    

### 🟥 Inverted Market (Backwardation)

- The curve **slopes downward**:  
    `Futures Price (Long-term) < Futures Price (Short-term)`
    
- Reflects:
    
    - **High immediate demand** or **supply disruption**.
        
    - **Buyers pay a premium** for near-term delivery.
        
- Common during:
    
    - **Supply shocks**, geopolitical tensions, or unplanned outages.
        
- Economically, this occurs when:

## 📏 What Does the Slope Tell Us?

### 📊 Steepness = Volatility Expectation

- A **steep slope**, whether rising or falling, suggests:
    
    - **High uncertainty** or **anticipated volatility** in the market.
        
- Traders interpret a steep curve as a **signal of possible violent price moves** in the near future.
    
    - Sharp contango: Storage oversupply, bearish sentiment.
        
    - Sharp backwardation: Urgent short-term demand, bullish tension.

## 📉 The Samuelson Effect

### 💡 What Is It?

- As futures contracts **approach maturity**, their prices become **more volatile**.
    
- Near-term futures are **highly reactive** to news and events.
    
- Long-term futures remain **relatively stable**, even when spot prices jump.
    

### 📉 Why It Happens

- Because **futures must converge to the spot price** at expiry.
    
- A **shock** (e.g., supply disruption) immediately affects:
    
    - The **spot price**.
        
    - And therefore, the **nearest-dated futures**.
        
- But further-out contracts are **less sensitive**, as they reflect **averaged expectations** over longer periods.
    

### 🔄 Intuition

- Think of it like weather:
    
    - A storm forecast for tomorrow radically changes your outfit plans (near-term = volatile).
        
    - A vague forecast for next month? You won’t act on it now (long-term = stable).

## 📉 Implications of the Samuelson Effect

- **Decreasing volatility** along the term structure:
    
    - Near-term contracts: **high variance**, **high trading volume**, strong reactions.
        
    - Long-term contracts: **low variance**, more muted price moves.
        
- **Flattening of the term structure**:
    
    - Over time, volatility differences between short- and long-dated contracts cause the curve to **flatten**.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- The term structure curve is a **snapshot of market expectations**, storage costs, and inventory pressures.
    
- Its **slope** and **steepness** convey:
    
    - Market state (normal vs inverted).
        
    - Anticipated volatility.
        
- The **Samuelson effect** explains why **near-term contracts** move more violently than long-term ones — due to their proximity to the spot price and fast convergence at expiry.
    
- For traders, understanding this helps with:
    
    - Position sizing.
        
    - Risk management.
        
    - Identifying arbitrage or hedging opportunities.
