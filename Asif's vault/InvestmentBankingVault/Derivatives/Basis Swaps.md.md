# 📘 Basis Swaps in Natural Gas Markets

## 🔹 What is a Basis Swap?
A basis swap is a derivative used to hedge the **price differential (basis)** between two natural gas delivery locations — most commonly between a specific location (e.g., Permian) and **Henry Hub** (the delivery point for NYMEX futures).

- **Basis = Index Price at Location − L3D (Last Trading Day) Futures Price at Henry Hub**
- Traded **Over-the-Counter (OTC)**
- Used for both **price discovery** and **basis risk management**

---

## 🔹 Mechanics of a Basis Swap

### 🎯 Contract Structure
- **Buyer pays**: L3D ± Negotiated Basis Differential  
- **Buyer receives**: Index Price at the alternate location

> ✅ Only the basis differential is fixed at the time of the trade.

### 💰 Payout = Index – (L3D ± Basis Differential)

---

## 🔹 Purposes of Basis Swaps

### 1. 📈 Price Discovery
- Determines forward gas prices at non-Henry Hub locations.
- **Formula**:  
  `Fixed Price at Location = Futures Price (L3D) ± Basis Differential`

### 2. 🛡️ Risk Management
- Hedges **basis risk**: risk that Henry Hub prices and alternate location prices move **unevenly**.
- Especially critical when using **futures or futures swaps** to hedge physical positions at non-Henry Hub locations.

## 🔹 Example Scenarios

### ✅ A. Hedging a Fixed-Price Sale
- FJS sells gas physically in **Permian at $1.75/MMBtu**
- Buys supply at **floating Index**
- Hedges with **long futures at $2.05** → basis risk remains
- **Buys Basis Swap**:
  - Pays: L3D – $0.35  
  - Receives: Index  
- If actual (Index – L3D) = –$0.40 → gain = $0.05/MMBtu  
- Fully hedged: price risk + basis risk eliminated

---

### ✅ B. Hedging a Fixed-Price Purchase
- FJS buys gas in **Permian at $1.75**
- Sells at **floating Index**
- Hedges with **short futures at $2.05** → basis risk remains
- **Sells Basis Swap**:
  - Receives: L3D – $0.25  
  - Pays: Index  
- If actual (Index – L3D) = –$0.20 → gain = $0.05/MMBtu  
- Fully hedged position

---

## 🔹 Factors Affecting Basis Differentials

- **Supply/Demand Fundamentals** at each location
- **Weather patterns**: the most impactful driver
- **Uncorrelated price movements** between Henry Hub and the alternate location
- **Transportation constraints or outages**

> 📌 Traders monitor regional fundamentals and weather forecasts to anticipate and profit from basis changes.

---

## 🔹 Trading Strategy

- **Buy low / Sell high** differential
  - Buy basis swap when differential is wide (expect tightening)
  - Sell basis swap when differential is tight (expect widening)
- Profit from **forecasting shifts** in basis between two locations

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
> **Basis swaps are critical tools for regional price hedging and arbitrage in natural gas markets.**  
> Understanding their structure, purpose, and drivers enables both risk management and speculative opportunity.
