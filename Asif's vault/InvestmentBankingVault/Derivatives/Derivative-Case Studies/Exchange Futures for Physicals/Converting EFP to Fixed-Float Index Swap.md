## ‚úÖ Concept: Converting an EFP into a Fixed-Float Index Swap

An **Index Swap (Fixed-for-Floating)** is a financial instrument where you:

- **Pay a fixed price** (e.g., $1.75/MMBtu),
    
- **Receive a floating index price** (e.g., Permian Gas Daily Index).
    

It‚Äôs a **pure financial contract** ‚Äî no physical gas is exchanged. The goal is to hedge or create synthetic exposure to the difference between **a fixed price and the local index**.

### üß† What‚Äôs Inside an EFP?

You buy a Permian EFP at:

- Posted Price = $2.00
    
- Differential = ‚Äì$0.25
    
- Invoice = $1.75
    

Which gives you:

- ‚úÖ Long physical gas at **Permian Index**
    
- ‚úÖ Long basis swap (Index ‚Äì $2.00 = ‚Äì$0.25)
    
- ‚ùå Short futures at $2.00

## üîß Steps to Convert EFP ‚Üí Index Swap

You‚Äôre trying to create a **Pay Fixed / Receive Index** financial swap. Here‚Äôs how you do it:

### Step 1: Convert EFP into a Basis Swap

- ‚úÖ Sell the physical gas at **Index**
    
- ‚úÖ Buy back the short futures  
    ‚Üí You‚Äôre left with a long basis swap at ‚Äì$0.25
    

### Step 2: Add a Futures Swap

- ‚úÖ Pay fixed $2.00
    
- ‚úÖ Receive L3D (or LTD) futures
    

### Resulting Position:

- ‚úÖ Long Basis Swap: Index ‚Äì L3D (at ‚Äì$0.25)
    
- ‚úÖ Long Futures Swap: L3D ‚Äì $2.00  
    ‚Üí Combine them:  
    **Index ‚Äì $2.00 + $2.00 = Index**
    

You're now left with:

> ‚úÖ Receive **Index**  
> ‚úÖ Pay **$1.75**  
> ‚û°Ô∏è ‚úÖ A synthetic **Fixed-Float Index Swap at $1.75**

## üßÆ Effective Price Logic

You paid $1.75 total (via EFP)  
You now receive **Index**  
So you're effectively in a swap that pays **$1.75 fixed** and receives **Index**

This lets you hedge a physical fixed-price gas sale or express a view on index strength.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This process involves:

1. Converting EFP into a **Basis Swap**
    
2. Adding a **Futures Swap**  
    ‚û°Ô∏è Result: ‚úÖ Synthetic **Index Swap** (Fixed-for-Floating)
