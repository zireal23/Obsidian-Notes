## üß† So Why Use Swing Swaps Over Vanilla Fixed-Float Swaps?

### ‚úÖ 1. **Daily Price Exposure Coverage**

- If you're buying/selling physical gas in the **day market** (e.g., gas is priced daily at index), then swing swaps **mirror your risk**.
    
- Vanilla fixed-float swaps don‚Äôt protect you against **volatile daily movements**, only the **average of the month**.
    

### ‚úÖ 2. **Better Hedge for Variable Demand / Load**

- Swing swaps are well-suited to **load-following supply** (like gas-fired power plants or city gate deliveries) where **volume and price fluctuate daily**.
    
- Vanilla swaps assume **constant volumes** and **monthly pricing**, making them **mismatched for operations** with real-world variability.
    

### ‚úÖ 3. **Speculative Edge on Daily Volatility**

- If you believe the **average of daily indexes** will diverge from the **monthly index**, or you're betting on **daily volatility**, swing swaps give you more room to profit or manage risk.
    
- Vanilla swaps are less sensitive to daily price patterns.
    

### ‚úÖ 4. **Alignment with Daily Cashflows**

- Physical gas is often invoiced based on **daily indexes** (e.g., Gas Daily Permian Index).
    
- Swing swaps **cash-settle against the same benchmarks**, making your P&L and hedging clean and traceable.
