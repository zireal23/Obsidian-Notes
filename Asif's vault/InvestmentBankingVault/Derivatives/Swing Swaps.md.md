## Trading Natural Gas: Swing Swaps

### Introduction to Swing Swaps

- Swing transactions in the physical natural gas market involve daily renegotiation of price and volume under interruptible contracts.
    
- These are highly popular and constitute the bulk of day-to-day trading.
    
- Historically, price discovery for specific, shorter tenures within a month was difficult.
    
- Swing swaps introduced a new hedging and trading instrument, aiding price discovery, hedging, and speculation in the day-to-day cash market.
    

### Definition of a Swing Swap

- A swing swap is a fixed-float index swap.
    
- It references the average of daily indexes from _Gas Daily_ as its floating price, unlike monthly indexes from _Inside FERC Gas Market Report_.
    
- The daily index is the simple average of the high and low prices published by _Gas Daily_ for a location on a trading day.
    
- For longer tenures, the simple average of daily indexes is the floating price.
    
- Typically, the buyer pays a fixed price and receives the daily index (or its average).
    
- Paying more than the average daily index for a swap results in a loss; paying less results in a profit.
    
- For weekends/holidays, the Monday price (or first day after holiday) is used for Saturday/Sunday (or the holiday).
    

### Applications for Swing Swaps

- Swing swaps are used for hedging fixed-price risk in day-to-day physical transactions, price discovery, and speculating on day-to-day market price changes.
    
- They derive value from fixed prices in the physical market, similar to a futures swap deriving value from a futures contract.
    

#### Producer Application Example

- FJS production company sold January gas at $2.00 in Permian under a firm contract.
    
- FJS expects prices to rise due to colder weather.
    
- To participate, FJS buys a Permian swing swap from XYZ for January 10th-31st at $2.00.
    
- **Effective sales price for FJS:** Average (daily Permian index 1/10-1/31).
    
- This converts FJS's fixed receipt into a floating price, increasing their effective sale price if daily fixed prices average higher than $2.00.
    

#### End User Application Example

- XYZ end user paid $2.00 for January gas in Permian under a firm contract.
    
- XYZ expects prices to fall due to warmer weather.
    
- To benefit, XYZ sells a Permian swing swap to FJS for January 10th-31st at $2.00.
    
- **Effective purchase price for XYZ:** Average (daily Permian index 1/10-1/31).
    
- This re-floats XYZ's fixed purchase price, reducing their effective price if daily fixed prices average lower than $2.00.
    

### Hedging a Swing Swap Purchase or Sale

- To hedge a swing swap, a trader needs to be able to trade physical gas at the swing swap's location in the day-to-day market.
    
- **Example:** Trader sells a January Permian swing swap at $2.00 and buys baseload Permian supply for the month at $1.95.
    
- Baseload contracts are recommended for hedging swing swaps due to the best-efforts basis and lack of certainty of performance in the day-to-day market.
    
- This trade earns a $0.05/MMBtu margin.
    
- The trader must sell the baseload supply daily at or above the middle of the published daily price range to gain the daily index for the swing swap.
    
- **Net profit for this hedged trade:** $0.05.
    
- Similar logic applies for buying a swing swap: sell baseload gas higher and buy daily to cover, aiming to pay the daily index or lower.
    

### Speculative Applications

- Speculators use swing swaps to participate in cash market fixed-price action without physical trading.
    
- Commonly, they buy or sell outright, anticipating price changes.
    
- **Spread trading** offers another opportunity, aiming for convergence or divergence of prices.
    
    - **Spread trading:** Taking opposite positions in adjacent months, expecting price convergence or divergence.
        
    - **Convergence:** Prices move towards the same level.
        
    - **Divergence:** Prices move away from each other.
        
    - **Month spreads:** Price differences between two months.
        
    - In futures, "selling the spread" (short higher, long lower) profits from convergence.
        
    - "Buying the spread" (long higher, short lower) profits from divergence.
        
- Henry Hub (NYMEX) or Waha Hub (KCBT) swing swaps can trade convergence between current month fixed physical gas prices and the nearby futures contract.
    
- Divergence trading is rare as cash and futures prices tend to converge near futures expiration.
    
- Convergence trading involves buying a swing swap and simultaneously shorting the nearby futures contract.
    
- This requires daily management: closing out an equal amount of the futures position as the swing swap's daily average erodes.
    
- Futures contracts expire 5 (KCBT) or 6 (NYMEX) business days before month-end, exposing the swing swap to cash market changes for the remaining days.
    
- Convergence opportunities often arise at the start of a new month.
    
- Swing swaps are also integrated into complex, structured transactions for customer flexibility.
